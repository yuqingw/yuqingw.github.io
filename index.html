							<h2>Hello, nice to meet you.<br />

						<p>I'm Hazel Wang, currently working as a business analyst at UOB, focused on delivering new mobile application features on the UOB Mighty mobile applicaiton. I have always been curious about new technology, and have a keen interest in product management and UX/UI design. Back in school, I majored in Information Systems, School of Computing at National University of Singapore.  I was also lucky to be part of the NUS Overseas College programme which gave me the opportunity to work at Agolo, a New York based startup. My various past working experiences have enabled me to have a deeper understanding of how technology can contribute to business success, and how it is important for one to stay relevant by continuously learning new things around us.</p>

								<h3>UOB MyKey for PayNow</h3>
								<p>With the implementation of PayNow, customers from 7 banks in Singapore can now transfer money to each other using either mobile number or NRIC. To further make the experience seamless, my team created a UOB MyKey feature for all UOB customers. This makes UOB the first bank in Singapore that lets our customers send money using any messaging app. Now customers can pay each other anywhere, anytime. Watch how it works <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=jFaknPyYKaA" target="_blank">here</a>. </p>

								<h3>UOB Mighty Dine</h3>
								<p>The UOB Mighty Dine feature allows customers to search, book, rate and review restaurants. It also lists all dining deals that are specially for UOB cardholders only. I was part of the Mighty Dine team to brainstorm new ideas for the existing feature, and improve on the overall UI/UX. With the Mighty Dine feature, customers now can look for dining deals at their finger tips without having to worry about missing out on the latest deals. </p>

								<h3>UOB Public Website</h3>
								<p>With the increasing adoption of smartphones and mobile devices of wide range of sizes, it is important for the website to be responsive and easy for mobile viewing. During one of my rotation at UOB, I was part of the team that worked on improving the design of the UOB public website. I was in charge of creating the website style guide for internal stakeholders to refer to when they upload content on the website. I also participated in user acceptance testing and proposed new changes to the website. </p>

								<h3>School Project - Information Systems Consulting</h3>
								<p>This is a IS consulting project that I have done in school, with a team of 6 members. We had the opportunity to work with Swissbake to propose new initiatives for their existing business process. This project allowed us to apply what we have learnt in school into real-life industry. We first understood the existing business process, and proposed new solutions that can turn the existing manual process into a digitally enabled process. The proposal included a mobile clickable prototype and a web data management platform. I was the UI/UX designer for the project. </p>

								<h3>SGX Mobile Application</h3>
								<p>During my 3 month internship at the Singapore Exchange (SGX), I joined the SGX mobile application team to propose new ideas for the SGX mobile application. Traditionally, stock boards are typically black in colour, with green and red text to represent stock prices. However, my team felt that black boards are typically straining on the eyes when users read them on their mobile phone. Thus, one change that we proposed is to change the black stock board to white. This facilitated the reading of stock information for users on mobile devices. My team and I also worked on other changes of the mobile application. I mainly played an UX designer/business analyst role for this internship. </p>
